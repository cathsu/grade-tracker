# Grade Tracker

## Project Description
For this project teams of three or four will work together to build an app used to track grades in their enrolled courses. 
The app will allow a user to create an account, login to their account, add courses, add grade categories to the courses, add assignments to the grade categories, and see a summary of their grades.
